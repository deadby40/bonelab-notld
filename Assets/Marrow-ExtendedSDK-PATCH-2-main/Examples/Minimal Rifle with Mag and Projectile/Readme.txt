MinimalCartridgeData has an 'issue' at the top of it, complaining about mismatched filenames. Do not click the "Fix object name" button, or your magazine will stop being pulled out of your ammo pouch ingame.

Similar to the existing mags, you can't spawn the mags in-game, as they have weird hitboxes, but you can pull it from your pouch if you have the ammo reserves.

This is a minimal example, of replacing the magazine, cartridges, and projectile.
You could use existing Magazine/Cartridge/Projectile data, to carve off work you need to do.
